# Twitter API

## Description

Got information about the users a user follows on Twitter, 
and added that information on a database using the pandas and sqlalchemy libraries.
Using the unittest library, I created a test method that will make sure
that the method where I am storing the data from the users in a dictionary is working correctly.
Lastly, I created yaml file that will check my code style using the PEP8 Style Guide every time I push a file on Github.

### Libraries
1. pytwitter
2. pandas
3. sqlalchemy
4. unittest
